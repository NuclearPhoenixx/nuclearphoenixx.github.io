## Description

Infiniterra developed as an idea to try and somewhat re-create the original feeling of Minecraft on a more modern platform, while expanding on a bunch of features, especially the ambiance and quality of life functions, but keeping it simple otherwise and remove most of the "modern bloat" that was added to Minecraft. This is also obivously necessary, of course, because otherwise there is no way the game would ever be finished.

The goal is straightforward: recreate something like the early Minecraft Java Alpha versions inside the Godot engine with a number of changes and improvements. Read about this in the [corresponding blog post](/2025/06/26/infiniterra).
