## Godot FOV TileMap

{% include gallery id="tilemap-gallery" %}

### Description

Simple Godot 3.x class that allows TileMap manipulation depending on a Camera2D's FOV. It loads and unloads all cells depending on Camera2D position and settings.

This allows you to, for example, easily work with a procedural map generator. You can add your generated cells to the map dictionary, so that you only have to generate around the Camera2D's FOV, but with a buffer of an arbitrary number of cells so that players won't notice.

## Rutherford Scattering Program

{% include gallery id="rutherford-gallery" %}

### Description

This simulation numerically solves the coupled differential equation for two charged particles interacting only via Coulomb's law. The resulting interaction is commonly known as Rutherford scattering or Coulomb scattering.

Standard values represent a Proton being fired at a gold nucleus representing the famous Geigerâ€“Marsden experiment (also known as Rutherford gold foil experiment).

## N-body Problem Program

{% include gallery id="nbody-gallery" %}

### Description

This simulation solves the n-body-problem numerically for theoretically infinite objects in a 2D plane. This means computing the vector of acceleration of each object resulting from the gravitational pull of the other objects. The number of calculation cycles per frame is given by the factor n \* (n - 1) where n is the number of spawned objects. The resulting force on each object will be calculated from a combination of all individual force vectors. Made with Godot Engine 3.x (no physics engine involved).

## Physics Pendulum Program

{% include gallery id="pendulum-gallery" %}

### Description

This simulation solves the accurate differential equation for a simple (mathematical) pendulum numerically in earth's field of gravity. Made with Godot Engine 3.x (no physics engine involved).

A video by 3Blue1Brown about differential equations inspired me to create this project.
