## Description

Heavily modified firmware for the Anycubic Kobra Neo. Based on the original by Anycubic, see below for all the changes. This firmware has been changed to be a drop-in replacement of the old firmware. This means that it retains all the original e-steps and PID values and tries to not change some other default values too aggressively. However, unlocks and similar features were kept of course. I also added some new stuff and changed some things up from the original jokubasver fork.

This is the most enhanced and modified Marlin-based firmware for the Neo at the moment. See below for an overview of the changes.
