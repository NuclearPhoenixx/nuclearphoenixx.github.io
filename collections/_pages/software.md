A selection of (open-source) software projects that I have been or am still currently working on. At this point, I have mainly worked in C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and with the Godot Engine. Include site-building using Jekyll in the list too ðŸ˜‰

I tried to categorize all related projects to keep them organized, so there might be more than one project per page.
