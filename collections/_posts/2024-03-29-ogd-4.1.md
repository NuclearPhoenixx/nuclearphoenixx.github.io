Did some work on the PCB and slightly updated the layout to make it all look better. The MCX connectors are now placed symmetrically on the board and the silk screen has had a heavy rework. On top of that I also added a grounded guard ring around the perimeter of the electronics section.

The only other change is a different type of 22ÂµF cap for bypassing, which now has an increased max voltage rating to better cope with DC bias. Other than that, everything remains the same.
