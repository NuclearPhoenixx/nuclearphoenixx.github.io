## Description

This cloud chamber is based on a standard dual-tower CPU cooler and a TEC2-25408 Peltier cooler. The Peltier cools down the 10 x 10 cm copper plate on top to less than -30Â°C so that the Isopropyl alcohol evaporating above condenses at the base, creating a thin fog layer. Ionizing radiation can then fly through this alcohol vapor and with some luck create a visible cloudy trace.

Trace thickness and length depends on the type of radiation: thin and long traces come from beta radiation and thicker as well as shorter traces are a sign of alpha particles.
