## Description

There are a lot of overpriced off-the-shelf IR tracking clips out there. Either you buy one of these, or you follow one of the countless tutorials online to build yourself your own clip. Most of these tutorial build something quick and dirty out of some PCB printed parts or even cardboard and most use either a permanent USB cable or some giant AA alkaline batteries. I didn't want to do any of that...

So I designed an all-in-one device that's made out of one piece of fibreglass (PCB) with a rechargable LiPo battery and some great LEDs with giant viewing angles. The whole thing is very sturdy and does not break or bend easily thanks to the PCB. It also makes assembly a lot easier, because it's literally _just_ the PCB. Battery life is around 10+ hours and it can be charged while using via a standard USB-C port. All of that also makes it extremely light-weight at just 20 grams or so.
